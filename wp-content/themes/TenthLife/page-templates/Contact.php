				<h2 class="h3">Visit the Tenth Life Adoption Lounge</h2>
		<p>We welcome visitors to drop in every weekend or by appointment.  We are located at 3202 Cherokee Street in Saint Louis, MO 63118. Our current visiting hours are listed on our home page (or by appointment). Please note that we do not have the ability to accept unscheduled admission of cats at our Cherokee Street location. If you are interested in admitting a cat, please start here.</p>
				
				<b>Sure, our adoption lounge is a fun and comfy place to kick back and hang out with cats while enjoying some coffee and free wifi. But did you know that we are also a valuable community resource center? </b>
				<p>We believe we can save more pets and decrease pet homelessness by equipping our community to be a part of the solution through empathic individual and group education. That's why our doors are open to the public weekly. You do not have to be looking to adopt a pet in order to visit our adoption lounge and resource center and there is no charge to visit and no time limit other than our open hours.</p>
				
				<p><b>We exist to help pets and work hard to keep people and pets together. </b></p>
				
				<p>We're here to connect you with the resources you need. Have questions? Need advice? Stop in and speak with a volunteer or staff member. </p>
				
				<p>We believe judgment is separation and we know that we can accomplish more together if we're kind and respectful of one another. When you enter our space, you are entering a judgment free zone. Please come as you are and ask any questions. All are welcome here. </p>
				
				
				<h2 class="orange">What are we doing?</h2>
				
				<p>We take pride in the fact that we have helped <b>450+ individuals and families</b> restore peace to their homes through our free behavior team, serving our community locally and as far away as France, Norway, South Africa, Abu Dhabi, and Saudi Arabia. Wherever you are, our volunteers want to help.</p>
				
				<p>In 2018 we served 122 individuals via our free behavior line and fielded 966 community phone calls. We committed to educational outreach visiting schools to provide humane education all while providing excellent veterinary care, foster homes, and adoptive placement to 163 felines, prioritizing those with special needs and injuries. We also welcome more than 2,000 visitors annually at our brick and mortar location on Cherokee Street in Saint Louis, Missouri. </p>
				
				<b class="orange">As of June 2019, we've fielded more than 4,000 community requests. </b>

					<h4>Admission Questions</h4>
					<p class="contact_links"><a href="mailto:admissions@tenthlifecats.org">admissions@tenthlifecats.org</a></p>
					<p>Unfortunately, we are unable to accept new admissions at Tenth Life on Cherokee Street because we have to protect the health and safety of the cats who reside in our small storefront. Most of our cats begin in foster homes before moving to Tenth Life on Cherokee Street (TLOC). The very best way to seek help is to email or call. </p>
					<p>Please note that we are not an emergency clinic and we do not currently have a veterinarian on staff. While we will reply as quickly as possible and do whatever we can to help, it is impossible for us to help every cat.  Please do not wait to hear from us or any rescue before seeking help for a cat who is in need of emergency medical attention. If necessary, you can find some wonderful local resources here including links to low-cost care options and additional local rescue organizations.</p>
