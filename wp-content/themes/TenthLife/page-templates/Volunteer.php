						<h4><span>STEP TWO</span></h4>
						<h3 class="big">Show Up</h3>
						<p class="smallp">Attend one of our monthly orientations at your earliest convenience. Orientations typically take place once a month at our storefront which is located at 3202 Cherokee Street in St. Louis and is ADA compliant. Training usually lasts about an hour and provides an overview of Tenth Life's mission and history, current volunteer roles and opportunities, and allows time for us to chat (often about cats), get acquainted, and answer your questions. We will also complete some paperwork and get all the red tape out of the way so you can get started. </p>

						<p class="smallp">Those with social anxiety need not worry as there will be cats there to act as a buffer and we are gentle and patient as a matter of character. We look forward to meeting you! If there is some reason that you cannot attend an orientation, please let us know.</p>

						<h4><span>STEP THREE</span></h4>
						<h3 class="big">Volunteer</h3>
						<p class="smallp">As we've mentioned, we ask that all new volunteers spend some time volunteering at our adoption center, learning more about us and our core values as a team. Initially, we request a commitment of at least once per month, for a minimum of three shifts at our storefront, before being trained to volunteer in other exciting ways. Please don’t let this commitment scare you away, as we are incredibly flexible and have many volunteer positions that might be exactly what you’re looking for! We just don’t like to hand them out to strangers so let’s be friends! If there is some reason that you cannot volunteer at our adoption center, please let us know.</p>
						<p class="smallp">We hope you’ll join us in making a major difference in the lives of homeless pets while getting to know others who share that passion and love to have fun while making the world a little bit brighter!</p>

                <div class="pd"></div>
                <p class="intro">Operated primarily by volunteers, we are always seeking highly motivated, cat-loving individuals at Tenth Life to help further our mission to give all cats the lives they deserve while prioritizing those with the most significant needs. </p>
			<p class="">Whether you want to help out with writing, fundraising, event planning and support, or any one of dozens of other incredibly valuable ways to be of service, we want to start by getting to know you. That’s why we ask that all new volunteers begin their journey with Tenth Life by spending some time with us at our adoption center on Cherokee Street, working alongside other volunteers and Tenth Life leadership. </p>
			<p class="">It is in this way that we can best get to know one another and that you will get a feel for our beloved community. </p>

		<ul class="accordion">
			<li>
				<a>What should I expect at orientation?</a>
				<p>During orientation, you will get a feel for our space and meet the cats that are currently in residence as we share a bit of Tenth Life's history, our hopes for the future, and our most pressing needs. We'll give you an overview of the positions that are available and most needed while also getting to know you, your passions, skills, and desire to help.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a>Do I have to attent orientation?</a>
				<p>Short answer, yes.</p>

				<p>Orientation is required so that we can get to know one another. Consider it a first date of sorts. Or the first step in training. We believe it helps if you really know our mission and vision so that you have a thorough understanding of who we are and what we expect from our volunteers before jumping in to help. There is a lot to learn and visitors and friends will ask questions. Lots of questions. We simply want to ensure that you have the tools to answer them or to know who to ask! </p>

				<p>While we prefer for volunteers to serve at our physical location as we get acquainted, we do have many roles that are easily performed remotely once you've gotten to know us a little better and are in the swing of things.</p>

				<p>If you honestly, truly cannot attend a group orientation and would like to request alternate arrangements, please email us. The link to do so is at the bottom of this page. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a>What if I cannot make orientation?</a>
				<p>We tend to host orientations around once a month and we really hope you can join a group. However, if you're really having trouble attending when we've scheduled orientation, please let us know and we'll see what we can do to accommodate you.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>Can minors volunteer?</a>

				<p>We love when anyone is learning to give back. However, please note that unaccompanied minors are never allowed in our space so anyone not of legal age must be accompanied by a legal guardian (trained as a volunteer) who is willing to guide them and ensure that they respect the cats, people, and rules in our space. </p>
			</li>


			<li>
				<a>Is Tenth Life's adoption lounge accessible?</a>

				<p>Tenth Life is wheelchair accessible. Our space does not have built-in wheelchair access; however, we do have a ramp and we're always happy to put it to good use. If there's ever any assistance you might need (specific needs, concerns, injuries, or limitations), please let us know so that we may be well prepared to make your visit a pleasant and easy one. If you would like to request a sign language interpreter or any other type of individual support, please give us one-two weeks of notice to search for a volunteer who can effectively assist you. If you have a caregiver or an assistant you'd like to attend alongside you, please let us know in advance so that we can be sure to accommodate your request appropriately. We're happy to do it!</p>
